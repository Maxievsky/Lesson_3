			<h2>Achieves highest Euro NCAP Overall Score under the new protocol</h2>

			<div class="text">
				<p>At Tesla, vehicle design is an iterative process through which we aim to make some of the <a href="https://www.tesla.com/safety">safest cars on the road</a> even safer. Today, Model Y is our latest vehicle to earn a 5-star safety rating from the European New Car Assessment Programme (Euro NCAP).</p>
				<p>As part of this assessment, Model Y received the highest Overall Score among any vehicle tested under Euro NCAP’s newest, most stringent test protocol. This was based on an evaluation of Model Y’s ability to protect adults, children and vulnerable road users like cyclists and pedestrians, as well as its safety assistance features.</p>

			<h2>Continuous Safety Improvements</h2>
			<div class="text">
				<p>Euro NCAP used new Model Y vehicles featuring our latest manufacturing techniques and safety features to complete their assessment:</p>


				<ul class="list">
					<li><p>Rear Underbody Casting: The rear underbody casting combined with our fortified battery pack provides immense crash strength to the safety cell, helping to maintain compartment integrity. This strength allows our advanced restraint systems to deploy effectively inside the cabin, holding occupants in place and providing protection against cabin intrusions.</p></li>
					<li><p>Far-Side Airbag: Provides additional protection during side impacts, especially when there are two front occupants. This airbag deploys between the front seats to help prevent head injuries that could be caused by occupant-to-occupant contact.</p></li>
				</ul>
